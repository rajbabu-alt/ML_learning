Absolutely — and nice progress 🔥
Since you learned cross-validation + feature engineering, here’s a clean GitHub profile README you can copy-paste.

✅ GitHub Profile README (Copy-Paste)

Create a repo with the same name as your GitHub username (example: rajbabupk/rajbabupk) and add this as README.md

# Hi, I'm Raj 👋

🚀 I’m learning Machine Learning and Generative AI, building projects step-by-step and sharing my journey publicly.

---

## 🎯 Current Focus
- Machine Learning fundamentals (training, evaluation, cross-validation)
- Feature Engineering & data preprocessing
- Building projects using Kaggle datasets
- Strengthening Python + NumPy + Pandas + Scikit-learn
- Preparing for a high-paying career in Generative AI

---

## 🧠 What I’m Learning Right Now
- Cross Validation (K-Fold, train/test split, model evaluation)
- Feature Engineering (creating meaningful features from raw data)
- Model performance metrics (accuracy, MAE, MSE, RMSE)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing

---

## 🛠 Skills & Tools
**Languages:** Python, SQL  
**Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn  
**Tools:** Kaggle, GitHub, Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 📌 Projects
Here are some projects I’m building while learning:

- 🔹 **Cancer Risk Prediction using Cigarette Consumption**
  - Simple dataset project exploring the relationship between cigarettes/day and cancer risk  
  - Regression + classification concepts  
  - Model evaluation + feature engineering  

- 🔹 **E-commerce Data Analysis (SQL + Pandas)**
  - Revenue, AOV, country-level insights  
  - Pivot tables and data cleaning  

*(More projects coming soon as I level up into Deep Learning and Generative AI.)*
